Bash Config
###########

This is repo for system agonistic bash preferences. This will be used on all of
my pcs at work and home, including servers

includes:
    .bashrc
    .bash_aliases
    .bash_aliases_home
    .bash_aliases_win

excludes:
    .bash_profile
    .bash_logoff

The excludes were made, because in practical terms they serve a system specific purpose. eg. I don't need to startx on anthing but my laptop.
